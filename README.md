# PigLatinTranslate

Pig Latin is a made-up children's language that's intended to be confusing. It obeys a few simple rules (below) but when it's spoken quickly it's really difficult for non-children (and non-native speakers) to understand.

Rule 1: If a word begins with a vowel sound, add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.

Rule 2: If a word begins with a consonant sound, move it to the end of the word, and then add an "ay" sound to the end of the word.

See <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_latin> for more details.
